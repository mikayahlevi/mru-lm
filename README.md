# transformer-train-script

## What is this?

This project is a script to train an LM forked from my transformer-train-script repo. This repo replaces attention with a novel idea called "matrix recurrent units."

## How to Use

Use the command `python main.py --device=cuda --dataset=tiny_stories.py`. Set `--dataset=shakespeare_char` for the character-level shakespeare dataset.
