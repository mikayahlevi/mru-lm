# mini-perfect-lm

## What is this?
This is a project forked from transformer-train-script, a little PyTorch script I made to train a transformer.
The objective of this project is to do research on how to improve LMs and try to incorporate cutting edge research as well to create a well-performing, small LM.

## How to Use
Use the command `python main.py --device=cuda --dataset=tiny_stories.py`. Set `--dataset=shakespeare_char` for the character-level shakespeare dataset.
